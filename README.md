COMMAND:

prq(data_path,results_path,table_path,ref_tag = 126,cutoff = 50,verbose = T)


ref_tag, cutoff and verbose have default values.

paths should be of the form (mac example) "/Users/username/folder/subfolder_or_file"
 

EXAMPLE USAGE: 

prq("/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/Raw Data/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/Results/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/six_plex_lookup.csv")

prq("/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/Raw Data/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/Results/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/six_plex_lookup.csv”,131,50,F)

prq("/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/AIBL/Raw Data/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/AIBL/Results/","/Users/stevenkiddle/mass_spec_pipeline/six_plex_lookup.csv”,verbose=F)


DATA FORMAT:

(NOTE: commas should be used to seperators, tabs seperation shown in this README for ease of reading only)


Raw data

Should be a folder containing files for each sixplex. Given below are the minimal columns needed, the expected column names and some example data. PRQ will ignore other columns. MS run IDs (‘MMS run’) must always be the leftmost column.

MMS_run	prot_acc 126_cor	127_cor	128_cor	129_cor	130_cor	131_cor	pep_seq	fraction
12801_5	P02671	515.14	230.82	12311.6	8022.74	751.26	345.9	MKGLIDEVNQDFTNR	5
12801_4	P01877	829.51	639.62	99.26	2003.11	9511.28	584.11	DASGATFTWTPSSGKSAVQGPPER	4


Subject path

Must point towards a .csv file giving the sample IDs for subjects in each 6plex with each tag. Columns must be in the order indicated here.

Patient_ID	six_plex	tmt_Label
652	1	12712	1	12884	1	12940	1	13015	1	13183	2	12749	2	128162	2	12996	2	13083	2	13188	3	12733	3	12838	3	12991	3	13058	3	131


LIMITATIONS:

Currently PRQ is not flexible for using data generated by n-plex’s with ’n’ not equal to 6. It is only compatabile with data for which a common reference was run with one of the tags. It is only made to analyse data generated from experiments which use 10 fractions of gel electrophoresis. It currently is only built to handle TMT tags 126-131. It is also not currently an R package.

PRQ could be extended to handle these situations, if anyone is interested in doing that I am happy to give advice.
